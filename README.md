# Tensorflow-Deep-learning
Using Tensorflow to construct and visualise multiple Machine learning models.

# Goals
* Self-teach Machine learning / Deep learning to an industry level
* Succesfully create multiple Machine learning models that involve re training to achieve better statistics
* Visualise each step including data and the models predictions against the training data 
* Master industry standard libraries/platforms such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

# Python libraries Used
* NumPy - To create multi-dimensional arrays, matrices etc. for Machine learning models.
* Pandas - For analysis and manipulation of tabular data in Dataframes i.e importing CSV's.
* Matplotlib - For data visualisation and graphical plotting of data.
* Scikit-learn - Tools for machine learning and statistical modelling i.e splitting data into test and training data
